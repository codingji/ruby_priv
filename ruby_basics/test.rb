Write a method that takes a string as an argument and groups the number of times each character appears in the string as a hash sorted by the highest number of occurrences.

The characters should be sorted alphabetically e.g:

get_char_count("cba") => {1=>["a", "b", "c"]}
You should ignore spaces, special characters and count uppercase letters as lowercase ones.
