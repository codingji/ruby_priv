Input: string object
Output: new array object containing palindromic sub strings as elements
?'s:
  1. does palindrome include spaces or non-alpha chars?
    - if theyre not included when determining palindromic quality, are they still output in the palindrome sub-string itself? ex. 'ta-t' => 'tat' or 'ta-t'?
  2. does order of substrings matter?
  3. is a single character considered a substring? a palindrome?
Reqs:
  - case sensitive
  - no palindrome present or empty input string => empty array object

Problems to Solve / Algos
  1. create all possible sub-strings
    - starting with first index, increasing slice length by one, until end of slice is last index of string
    - keep track (push) each substring to some method local array object if its a palindrome
      2. determine if substring is a palindrome
        - are forwards and backwards versions of the substring the same?
    - then move starting index 'up' one
    - repeat until starting index and final index of string are the same, then stop.

  ```ruby
  def palindrome?(string)
    string.length > 0 &&
    string.chars == string.chars.reverse
  end


  # p palindrome?('cat')
  # p palindrome?('dopapod')
  # p palindrome?('tat')
  # p palindrome?('t')
  # p palindrome?('')


  def palindrome_substrings(strinput)
    palindromic_substrings = []

    strinput.chars.each_with_index do |letter, index|
      sub_string = strinput.chars[index..strinput.length - 1]
      # Create substrings of substring and determine if its a palindrome
      while sub_string.length > 1
        palindromic_substrings << sub_string.join if palindrome?(sub_string.join)
        sub_string.pop
      end
    end
    p palindromic_substrings
  end

  palindrome_substrings("supercalifragilisticexpialidocious") == ["ili"]
  palindrome_substrings("abcddcbA") == ["bcddcb", "cddc", "dd"]
  palindrome_substrings("palindrome") == []
  palindrome_substrings("") == []

## Understanding the problem

> Imagine a sequence of consecutive even integers beginning with 2. The integers are grouped in rows, with the first row containing one integer, the second row two integers, the third row three integers, and so on. Given an integer representing the number of a particular row, return an integer representing the sum of all the integers in that row.

```
1| [2]
2| [2, 3]
3| [2, 3, 4]
4| [2, 3 , 4, 5]
```

Given an integer that reps the line/iteration/number of ints, return the sum of that line of numbers which counts from 2 up to (input argument times)

I/O:
- Input: integer
- Output: integer rep sum of line 'selected' by input integer argument

Reqs:
- Explicit:  input will be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1

Problems:
- determining what is in each row without having to iterate through all the previous rows (this would be wasting a lot of time and resources)
  - start counting from two, then push each consecutive integer (+= 1) until i have done that operation the same number of times as the input integer
- sum the contents of the 'row'
- return sum

```ruby
def sum_num_rows(int)
  # row = []

  # int.times do |iteration|
  #   row << 2 + iteration
  # end

  # row.sum
  # OR simply:

  [*2..int + 1].sum
end

p sum_num_rows(4)

```


# How would you implement this method?

```ruby
produce = {
  'apple' => 'Fruit',
  'carrot' => 'Vegetable',
  'pear' => 'Fruit',
  'broccoli' => 'Vegetable'
}

# Ans:


select_fruit(produce) # => {"apple"=>"Fruit", "pear"=>"Fruit"}
```

> Note that we chose to not name the method select because of **collision** with Kernel#select, which does something completely different than what we're talking about here with collections.

COLLISION - when a user defined method/variable name shares a name with a built in method

```ruby
def double_numbers!(array, factor)
  counter = 0
  loop do
    if counter.odd?
      array[counter] = array[counter] * factor
    end
    
    counter += 1
    break if counter >= array.length
  end
  array
end


my_numbers = [1, 4, 3, 7, 2, 6]
p double_numbers!(my_numbers, 3) # => [2, 8, 6, 14, 4, 12]
```

Let's write a method called select_letter, that takes a string and returns a new string containing only the letter that we specified. We want it to behave like this:


```ruby
def select_letter(string, letter)
  bucket = ''
  for char in string.chars
    if char == letter
      bucket << char
    end
  end
  bucket
end

question = 'How many times does a particular character appear in this sentence?'
p select_letter(question, 'a') # => "aaaaaaaa"
p select_letter(question, 't') # => "ttttt"
p select_letter(question, 'z') # => ""


```
